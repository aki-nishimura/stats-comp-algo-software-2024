# Exercise 0:

Watch the following videos from  Part "The Central Processing Unit (CPU): Crash Course Computer Science" from PBS to better understand how CPU works and what affects its computational performance:

* [The Central Processing Unit (CPU)](https://youtu.be/FZGugFqdr60?si=Cth8Sw_Z_p7Jwqvg)
* [Instructions & Programs](https://youtu.be/zltgXvg6r3k?si=1jRqi8x6rfiQ4Gri)
* [Advanced CPU Designs](https://youtu.be/rtAlC5J1U40?si=VCicsBN-GGMVX4ty)

**Question:** 
In class, we have observed that execution speed of the `sign_via_if()` Rcpp function can depend on the value of an input vector.
What feature(s) of a modern CPU is (are) responsible for this?
And where in the above videos is this explained?
Provide a rough starting time point in (e.g. "19:18") of the discussion.

**My Answers:**
The `sign_via_if()` Rcpp function can have its execution speed influenced by many features of a modern CPU.

First, **branch prediction** plays a significant role. This feature allows the CPU to anticipate the outcome of a conditional operation, such as one of the if-else statements in the `sign_via_if()` function, before it happens. When the CPU's prediction aligns with the actual outcome, it can proceed with executing instructions without delay, enhancing the execution speed. However, if the prediction is incorrect, known as a "branch misprediction," the CPU must discard the prematurely-executed instructions and wait for the conditional operation to complete, which slows down the execution. This concept is discussed in the "Advanced CPU Designs" video, starting around the 8:53 mark.

Second, the **caching** mechanism of CPUs can also affect the execution speed. CPUs use caches to quickly access data that is frequently used or expected to be used soon. If the data required for an operation is already in the cache, referred to as a "cache hit," the CPU can access it faster than if it has to fetch it from the main memory, a "cache miss." The distribution of values in the input vector to `sign_via_if()` could influence the cache hit rate, and consequently, the execution speed. The concept of caching is introduced around the 3:16 mark in the "Advanced CPU Designs" video.

Last, **instruction pipelining** can influence the execution speed. This technique enhances the CPU's instruction throughput by dividing the processor's work into a series of independent steps, each of which can be executed by different processor units simultaneously. This concept is explained starting around the 5:34 mark in the "Advanced CPU Designs" video.

# Exercise 1: Coding on the edge &mdash; being responsible for your own safety in the C++ world

## Part A: Buggy inner product

Below is a (buggy) Rcpp implementation of an inner product calculation. 

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Ignoring the bug for the moment, run the code below and see what you get.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp"))

vec_size <- 1023L
v <- rep(1, vec_size)
w <- rep(1, vec_size)
inner_prod(v, w)
```

Still ignoring the bug, run the code below that calculates the same inner product many times and checks whether the output remains the same.
I mean, whether there is a bug or not, an output of a deterministic calculation should surely be the same each time?
Try running the code chunk multiple times. 

```{r, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
first_val <- inner_prod(v, w)

for (i in 1:10^6) {
  v <- rep(1, vec_size)
  w <- rep(1, vec_size)
  subseq_val <- inner_prod(v, w)
  if (!identical(first_val, subseq_val, num.eq = TRUE)) {
    print(subseq_val)
    stop("The last inner prod result disagrees with the previous ones.")
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
What behavior do you observe above? How do you explain it?

**My Answers:**
The final outcome of the inner product computation is inconsistent with earlier results, and the product's value alters each time the code is executed. This inconsistency arises because the index variable `i` is incorrectly initialized at 1 instead of 0, and it iterates up to `v.size()` rather than `v.size() - 1` within the loop. In the context of C++ and Rcpp, array indices start from 0. Consequently, an error occurs when attempting to access an invalid element at `v[i]` where `i` equals `v.size()`.

## Part B: Sloppy matrix-matrix multiplication

You have been told by the instructor that error-checking is particularly important in C++ and, in particular, that you should probably check for the dimension compatibility before you multiply two matrices in Rcpp(Eigen).
But it would be fair enough to wonder: is that dude really worth listening to?
I'll leave that for you to judge, but for this part of exercise let's consider what might happen if we remove such a safeguard from an Rcpp matrix-matrix multiplication.
Below is an implementation without the dimension check: 

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Run the code below using the above "unprotected" matrix-matrix multiplication.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp"))

A <- matrix(1, nrow = 4, ncol = 1024)
B <- matrix(1, nrow = 512, ncol = 2)

dgemm_eigen(A, B)
```

**Questions:**
What do you get as an output? What if you re-run the code chunk? Explain the observed behavior.

**My Answers:**
The result is a 4 by 2 matrix, where the first column is a repetition of 1024 four times, and the second column generates random numbers each time the code is executed. Matrix A has dimensions 4 $\times$ 1024, and matrix B has dimensions 512 $\times$ 2. When the matrices' dimensions are not suitable for multiplication, the output defaults to a shape with the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix. Both matrices A and B are stored in a contiguous memory block in column-major order. Therefore, when computing the dot product of each row of A (length = 1024) with the first column of B (length = 512), the computer accesses a 1024-length vector of 1's for matrix B (since B is stored and allocated in a 1024-length vector), leading to a repeated 1024 for the first column in the output. However, when performing the dot product of A's rows with B's second column, the computer accesses a 1024-length vector, the first half of which is stored as B's second column, and the second half is undefined due to unallocated space, resulting in a random and incorrect second column in the output.

## Part C: Consequence of "tresspassing"

The code below uses the `axpy_c()` function as seen in lecture.
Run it and see what happens. 
(I am not sure if the behavior is reproducible 100% of time; if you don't observe anything striking, restart the R session and run the code chunk in a fresh state.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "axpy_c.cpp"), rebuild = TRUE)

a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e7L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e3L)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

Now try running the code below; it should execute just fine unlike the above one.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e3L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e7L)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

**Questions/To-do's:**

* What happens when you run the first code chunk above and why? 
Running the same piece of code from an R console (instead of an RStudio session) should give you more information on what actually happens.
* Why does the second code chunk run fine?
* Modify `axpy_c.cpp` to make the function safer to use.

**My Answers:**
The R session terminated when executing the first code chunk above. This occurred because the y vector's length is 1e3, while the x vector's length is 1e7. This discrepancy causes the loop in `axpy_c()` to try to access memory beyond y's boundaries when operating on indices of x that exceed 1e3. The second code segment executed successfully because the x vector and y vector have lengths of 1e3 and 1e7, respectively. The operation is performed within the confines of the x and y vectors in the loop, with the first 1e3 elements of y being modified and the remaining elements remaining unchanged. I've modified `axpy_c.cpp` to make the function safer to use.

# Exercise 2: Multiplying two matrices ain't quite what you learned in your linear algebra class

## Part A: Paying homage to your linear algebra teacher

As we all learned in our linear algebra class, the matrix product $\boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B}$ of $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and $\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times p}$ has its elements defined as
$$C_{ij} = \sum_{\ell = 1}^k A_{i\ell} B_{\ell j}.$$
So a conceptually natural way to implement a matrix multiplication is looping through each row of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and column of $\boldsymbol{B}$, taking inner products of the pairs of vectors:

![](figure/matrix_multi_via_row_col_dot.gif){width=30%}

Implement a matrix-matrix multiplication based on this approach as `row_col_dot_matmat` using the starter code provided in the `matmat.cpp` file.
Then check that its output agrees with the base R matrix multiplication.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "matmat.cpp"))
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
n_row_out <- 1024L
n_inner <- 2048L
n_col_out <- 512L
A <- matrix(rnorm(n_row_out * n_inner), nrow = n_row_out, ncol = n_inner)
B <- matrix(rnorm(n_inner * n_col_out), nrow = n_inner, ncol = n_col_out)
```

```{r}
# Check the output of `row_col_dot_matmat`
r_result <- A %*% B
cpp_row_result <- row_col_dot_matmat(A, B)
all.equal(r_result, cpp_row_result)
```

**My Answers:**
Please see `matmat.cpp` for my implementation. The outputs from the base R matrix multiplication and `row_col_dot_matmat` in the code chunk above agree.

## Part B: Going one step beyond your linear algebra class

We now consider an alternative approach to matrix-matrix multiplications, noting that we can think of a matrix product $\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B}$ as each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ multiplied by $\boldsymbol{A}$:
$$\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} = \big[ \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_1 \, | \, \ldots \, | \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_p \, \big].$$
Recalling from lecture that "column-oriented" matrix-vector multiplication is more efficient than "row-oriented" one for R matrices, implement `col_oriented_matmat` (in `matmat.cpp`) that loops through each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ applying the column-oriented matrix-vector multiplication.
Then compare performances of `row_col_dot_matmat` and `col_oriented_matmat` (but only after you test your column-oriented implementation).
Which one is faster and why?

```{r}
# Check and benchmark
cpp_col_result <- col_oriented_matmat(A, B)
all.equal(r_result, cpp_col_result)

library(microbenchmark)
bench::mark(
  row_col_dot_matmat(A, B)
)
bench::mark(
  col_oriented_matmat(A, B)
)
```

Also compare with performance of the matrix-matrix multiplication via `%*%` in R, which uses whatever the BLAS library your R was configured with.
(You can find out which BLAS library R is using via `sessionInfo()` or `extSoftVersion()`.) 

```{r}
bench::mark(
  A %*% B
)
```

When benchmarking alternative implementations (or alternative algorithms, more generally), keep in mind that the relative performance depends significantly on the size of a test problem.
It is important, therefore, to benchmark your implementation/algorithm on problems of realistic size. 
See the benchmark results of linear algebra libraries from [the Eigen development team](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark) and the results under "Gcbd benchmark" in [this github repository](https://github.com/andre-wojtowicz/blas-benchmarks), for example.

**My Answers:**
Please see `matmat.cpp` for my implementation.

The `col_oriented_matmat` method (median = 737ms) outperforms the `row_col_dot_matmat` method (median = 5.05s) because matrix multiplication tends to be slower when using row operations, as matrices are stored as column vectors. When a row operation is performed, the processor accesses memory in a non-sequential manner, which can slow down the process due to the need to retrieve data from various memory locations.

The base R matrix multiplication operator `%*%` (median = 744ms) is marginally slower than the `col_oriented_matmat` method implemented in Rcpp. This could be attributed not only to the efficient column-oriented matrix-vector multiplication used in the latter algorithm but also to the fact that C++ code can be optimized by the compiler for more efficient execution.

## Part C: Doing it the right way

Part A & B are meant to get you some practice writing Rcpp code and to illustrate how much an algorithm's performance depends on whether or not it respects an underlying representation of data.
Neither of the approaches we've discussed, however, is the most effective way to multiply two matrices on modern hardware.

Dedicated linear algebra libraries typically deploy _blocking_, dividing the matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ into sub-matrices of appropriate size and carrying out multiplications block-wise.
This approach is designed to minimize the data motion between CPU and RAM by re-using the same pieces of data as much as possible once they travel all the way from RAM to L1 cache.
In practice, we of course shouldn't try to implement, let alone optimize, an operation ourselves when there already are efficient software libraries available.
(But, if you are interested in learning more about how the optimized matrix multiplication works, Sec 1.5.4. of Golub and Van Loan (2013) is a good place to start. Also, I found nice lecture slides on this topic [here](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/lecture/18cacheX.pdf).)

### Rcpp, Eigen, and compiler options
With the interface provided by RcppEigen, the C++ linear algebra library [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) is one obvious choice for dealing with computationally intensive numerical linear algebra tasks in R.
But the optimized C++ code provided by Eigen is _only one part of the equation_:
in order to achieve the best performance, we have to provide appropriate instructions to the compilers on how to translate the C++ code into machine code specific to each hardware and operating system.
These instructions are given in terms of _compiler flags_. 
I am far from an expert on compiler flags, so the rest of discussion is accurate only to the best of my knowledge 
&mdash; let me know if you find out any part of it to be inaccurate.

Rcpp by default applies the level 2 optimization via flag `-O2` when compiling your Rcpp code.
This flag is a shorthand for turning on a collection of more specific flags and generally leads to efficient machine code without any major drawbacks.
I've been told that the more aggressive level 3 optimization via `-O3` can sometimes hurt performance or even break things.
Which specific flags `-O2` activates to some extent depends on which (version of) compiler you are using.
Generally speaking, however, the level 2 optimization misses some of the important optimization opportunities for scientific computation, such as fused multiply-add (FMA) and AVX's 256-bit vectorized operation discussed in class.
SSE's 128-bit vectorization seems to be activated by `-O2` with Clang (the default compiler for macOS) as of version 12.0.0, but I am not sure how to confirm it and [their documentation is not particularly helpful](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/clang.html#cmdoption-o0).
If you are on Linux and using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), then you can run `gcc -O2 -Q --help=target` to find out which exact options are enabled by the `-O2` option.

In compiling Rcpp code, you can turn on and off these additional options by modifying the R version of a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefiles) called `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` for Unix and Windows respectively. 
To specify the compiler options for a specific R package, you can place such an Makevars file under the `src/` directory.
To specify the global options that affect all Rcpp code compilations on your computer, you can edit the Makevars file at the location given by `tools::makevars_user()`, which is typically `~/.R/Makevars` in Unix.
For example, to turn on AVX(2) and FMA, you would add a line `CXXFLAGS += -mavx2 -mfma` in the Makevars file; 
to turn off SSE, you woud add `CXXFLAGS += -mno-sse`.
You can read more about the role of Makevars files [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43597632/understanding-the-contents-of-the-makevars-file-in-r-macros-variables-r-ma).

**To-do's:**
Using the `dgemm_eigen()` function from lecture, compare the performances of Eigen's and your custom matrix-matrix multiplication compiled under different optimization options.
Selectively turn on and off SSE, AVX2, and FMA to see how each option affects the performances. 
(SSE should be turned on by `-O2` unless explicitly turned off, but if `-mno-sse` makes no performance difference, then try `-msse` or `-msse4`.)
Finally, turn on both AVX2 and FMA and check the resulting performances.
Report what you find.

Next, implement an RcppEigen function `dgemv_eigen()` that computes the matrix-vector product $A v$ given the input matrix $A$ and vector $v$ of compatible sizes.
Then, using the same matrix $A$ as an input to `dgemv_eigen()`, repeat the above experiment of turning on and off the optimization flags.
Contrast the results on the matrix-vector operation with those on the matrix-matrix operation using RcppEigen.
Explain why these hardware optimization options may have the different degrees of impacts on performance.

Run the above experiment both on your own computer and on a JHPCE node.
In case you have a Mac computer with Apple silicon, then the experiment won't work on your computer, so just use JHPCE.
In addition to the results, report the CPU model on the JHPCE node you ran the experiment on;
you can check this via the `lscpu` command. 
The few really old nodes on JHPCE do not support AVX and FMA, so switch to another node in case you get assigned to those nodes.
You can check supports for AVX and FMA from the output of `lscpu`; try `lscpu | grep avx` and `lscpu | grep fma`.


```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Import `dgemm_eigen()` from lecture
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("..", "lecture", "src", "gemm_eigen.cpp"), rebuild = TRUE)
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "matmat.cpp"), rebuild = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Benchmark
bench::mark(
  dgemm_eigen(A, B)
)
bench::mark(
  row_col_dot_matmat(A, B)
)
bench::mark(
  col_oriented_matmat(A, B)
)
```

**My Answers:**
From the table below, it's clear that `dgemm_eigen()` consistently outperforms the other two algorithms, with the column-wise operation coming in second and the row operation trailing behind. Without any optimization options enabled, `dgemm_eigen()` operates at a slower pace (median = 203ms), but this speed significantly improves when SSE (median = 112ms) is activated. The performance further enhances when either AVX2 (median = 57.9ms) or FMA (median = 39.9ms) is turned on, with FMA proving to be the most effective in speeding up `dgemm_eigen()`. Interestingly, the execution times for `col_oriented_matmat()` and `row_col_dot_matmat()` don't show substantial improvements with any of the optimization options.

| Flag(s) | `dgemm`(median ms) | `row`(median s) | `col`(median ms) |
|------|------|------|------|
| None | 203  | 5.13 | 769 |
| SSE  | 112  | 3.12 | 517 |
| AVX2  | 57.9 | 2.65 | 498 |
| FMA  | 39.9 | 3.65 | 514 |
| SSE, AVX2 | 50.3 | 3.28 | 516 |
| AVX2, FMA | 39.6 | 3.69 | 529 |
| SSE, FMA | 39.7 | 3.07 | 509 |
| SSE, AVX2, FMA | 42.5 | 3.21 | 517 |

Please see `gemm_eigen.cpp` for my implementation of `dgemv_eigen()`. As shown in the table below, the execution times for `dgemv_eigen()` don't show substantial improvements with any of the optimization options, unlike the matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm `dgemm_eigen()`.

Matrix-matrix multiplication is a highly parallelizable operation. It involves the multiplication of each element in a row of the first matrix with each element in a column of the second matrix, and these multiplications can be performed simultaneously (i.e., independently). This is where hardware optimization options like SSE, AVX2, and FMA can significantly speed up computation, as they enable the use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations (which allow multiple data points to be processed at once).

On the other hand, matrix-vector multiplication is less parallelizable. It involves the multiplication of each element in a row of the matrix with a corresponding element in the vector, and these multiplications are then summed to produce a single result. While there is some level of parallelism (or independence) in this operation, it's not as high as in matrix-matrix multiplication. Also, in general, there are less computations in matrix-vector multiplication compared to matrix-matrix multiplication. These reasons are why the performance improvements from hardware optimization options are not as pronounced for `dgemv_eigen()` as they are for `dgemm_eigen()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
v <- rnorm(n = 2048, mean = 5, sd = 2)
  
bench::mark(
  dgemv_eigen(A, v)
)
bench::mark(
  row_col_dot_matmat(A, as.matrix(v))
)
bench::mark(
  col_oriented_matmat(A, as.matrix(v))
)
```

| Flag(s) | `dgemv`(median $\mu$s) | `row`(median ms) | `col`(median ms) |
|------|------|------|------|
| None | 823 | 14 | 1.86 |
| SSE  | 801  | 17.1 | 1.92 |
| AVX2  | 755 | 12.4 | 1.90 |
| FMA  | 723 | 16 | 1.78 |
| SSE, AVX2 | 747 | 15.3 | 1.65 |
| AVX2, FMA | 692 | 19.1 | 1.84 |
| SSE, FMA | 741 | 16.9 | 1.82 |
| SSE, AVX2, FMA | 678 | 17.4 | 1.76 |

I also ran the experiments above on a JHPCE node (Compute-153 with CPU model Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6338 CPU @ 2.00GHz) with the following results:

| Flag(s) | `dgemm`(median ms) | `row`(median s) | `col`(median ms) |
|------|------|------|------|
| None | 198  | 4.89 | 765 |
| SSE  | 102  | 3.01 | 492 |
| AVX2  | 49.8 | 2.45 | 467 |
| FMA  | 27.9 | 2.66 | 499 |
| SSE, AVX2 | 41.5 | 3.07 | 488 |
| AVX2, FMA | 23.3 | 3.42 | 471 |
| SSE, FMA | 22.6 | 2.78 | 454 |
| SSE, AVX2, FMA | 24.4 | 2.55 | 423 |

| Flag(s) | `dgemv`(median $\mu$s) | `row`(median ms) | `col`(median ms) |
|------|------|------|------|
| None | 798 | 13.2 | 1.73 |
| SSE  | 764  | 11 | 1.79 |
| AVX2  | 689 | 9.48 | 1.71 |
| FMA  | 691 | 9.52 | 1.68 |
| SSE, AVX2 | 647 | 9.44 | 1.57 |
| AVX2, FMA | 625 | 9.21 | 1.76 |
| SSE, FMA | 643 | 9.22 | 1.65 |
| SSE, AVX2, FMA | 609 | 10.1 | 1.56 |

Here, we can observe that the performances of both `dgemm_eigen()` and  `dgemv_eigen()` are improved by the hardware optimization options more on the JHPCE than on my own computer. This is likely due to the fact that the JHPCE node I was working on has a more modern CPU with better support for these optimization options.

# Exercise 3: Continuing development of `hiperglm` &mdash; optimizing its performance via RcppEigen

In the previous assignment, you improved the numerical stability of the `hiperglm` package by replacing the pseudo-inverse within Newton's method with the QR-based weighted least-square solver.
In this assignment, you will improve the computational speed by interfacing the package with RcppEigen.

Before you start this assignment, remember to first address all the feedback from the previous assignment and merge your previous work to the main branch. 
Then create a new `rcpp-eigen` branch from there, check it out, and commit all your work for this assignment there.
Finally, open a pull request into your main branch after completing the assignment and request a review from the TA.

1. Use `usethis::use_rcpp_eigen()` to set up the use of Rcpp(Eigen) within the package.<br>
_Remark:_
Within an R package, Rcpp code needs to be placed in `.cpp` files under the `src/` directory. 
After you've written Rcpp functions, you need run `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` to make those functions available to the rest of the package.
See the ["Using Rcpp in a package"](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html#rcpp-package) section in _Advanced R_ and references therein if you want to learn more. 
2. Replace base R's QR functions with RcppEigen's and test that their outputs agree.
Don't forget to run `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` after writing Rcpp functions. 
Below you find tips on how to use Rcpp(Eigen) which, combined with the lecture materials, should be sufficient for completing this step:
    * Calling the constructor function `Eigen::HouseholderQR<Eigen::MatrixXd> qr(A);` computes the QR decomposition of a given `A` of type `Eigen::MatrixXd` and assigns it to the variable `qr`. 
    In other words, this is a shorthand for initializing the variable `qr` by first calling `Eigen::HouseholderQR<Eigen::MatrixXd> qr(A.rows(), A.cols());` and then actually computing and assigning to `    qr` the output of QR decomposition by calling `qr.compute(A);`.
    You can then call `qr.solve(y);` to compute the least squares solution $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \boldsymbol{R}^{-1} \boldsymbol{Q}^\intercal \boldsymbol{y}$.
    * If you want to use `using ...;` within a package, you have to place these statements within a header file called `pkgname_types.h` under `src/` and include it in the `.cpp` files via `#include "pkgname_types.h"`.
    For example, the name of the header file should be `hiperglm_types.h` in our case.
    *  _Remark:_ You can find more about Eigen's HouseholderQR class  [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1HouseholderQR.html).
    Note that, as typical of many cutting-edge open-source technologies, their documentations are generally adequate but not particularly user-friendly.
    Some of the details might just require educated guesses and trial-and-errors. 
    You can find useful examples in Dirk Eddelbuettel's [page on RcppEigen](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.eigen.html).
    But then RcppEigen is just an Rcpp wrapper of Eigen, so you might just have to refer to Eigen's documentation for further details. 
3. Incorporate the least squares solver via Eigen's QR into the IWLS algorithm for finding MLE.
Make it the default option and check that all the tests still pass when using the QR-based solver.
