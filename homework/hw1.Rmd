# Exercise 0: Setting up Git and Github

## Part 1: Command line interface 

Set up your Git and Github. 
You can find many resources regarding this online, including [a guide from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
Another nice one is Karl Broman's [minimal git/github tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/).
Make sure you at least set your Git username and commit email.

In this course, you will be mainly interacting with Git through its command-line interface. 
(In particular, I am not going to help you if you get yourself into trouble by using a Git GUI, like the RStudio one.)
If you are on Windows, you can use [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash). 
If you are on Mac, I recommend you use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), instead of the built-in Terminal, along with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and its [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. 
If you are on Linux, most likely you don't need my suggestions :-)

Besides the bare minimum Git set-up, you should also set up the default editor and visual diff tool. 
I personally use Sublime Text as the Git editor on macOS and, for those on Windows, Notepad++ is one popular option. 
As for visual diff, I like [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) but it is currently unavailable for latest macOS versions, unfortunately;
so I have been using [KDiff3](https://apps.kde.org/kdiff3/) instead.
The following commands tell Git to use Sublime and KDiff3:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git config --global core.editor subl --wait
git config --global diff.tool kdiff3
git config --global --add difftool.prompt false
```

All the above commands do is to simply modify the "global" `.gitconfig` file, typically located in your home directory. You can find the exact location of this file is via the command `git config --list --show-origin`. 

## Part 2: Graphical user interface

While I've just told you to use the command-line to interact with Git, a Git GUI can be a valuable tool for visually examining the current and past states of a repo.
So, my recommended workflow is to interact with Git via command-line (b/c it gives you more precise controls) but to use a GUI for visualizing the repo. 
I personally have been a happy user of a cross-platform [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), the Pro version of which is freely available via [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/).
(Actually, the Free version should suffice for the purpose of this course;
but you need the Pro version for a Git repo with private remote.)
But other freeware like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) should work fine for the intended use of simply visualizing the repo. 

This part of the exercise used to be optional because it seems silly to micromanage peoples' workflows, but I have had many students not take my recommendation only to later tell me they wish they started using a Git GUI earlier.
So I am going to ask you to give it a try at least and to submit a screenshot of a package's Git history in Exercise 2.

## Things to commit and submit

The content of `.gitconfig` showing a proper Git set-up (though you would normally access this information via `git config` commands).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Paste the output of `cat .gitconfig` here
[core]
        editor = \"C:\\Users\\Alex\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin\\code\" --wait
[user]
        name = thepianistalex
        email = llang7@jh.edu
[init]
        defaultBranch = main
[gui]
        recentrepo = C:/Users/Alex/Desktop/planets
[diff]
        tool = kdiff3
[difftool]
        prompt = false
```



# Exercise 1: Playing around with command-line and Git

## Part A

Log in to JHPCE and `srun --pty bash` to be assigned a compute node. 
For this exercise, we use the `homework/git_experiment` folder from the course repository, so clone the repo to your JHPCE home directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/aki-nishimura/stats-comp-algo-software-2024
```

Next, copy the `git_experiment` folder via a command `cp -r git_experiment git_experiment_copy` (`-r` for "recursive" copy that includes the folder's contents and sub-directories).
Go into the copied folder, initialize it as a git repo (yes, you can have a git repo within another git repo), and commit `foo.tex`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git init
git add foo.tex
git commit -m "TeX file for experiment" 
```

Then try compiling the tex file via command-line, which can be done via:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
module load tex
pdflatex foo.tex
``` 

You can suppress the compilation messages by redirecting the `stdout` to `/dev/null`:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pdflatex foo.tex > /dev/null
```

For the rest of this exercise, you use a "stream" editor _sed_. 
A stream editor processes a text file line-by-line, without ever loading the entire file into memory. 
This is useful when, for example, you are processing a massive text file containing data and you cannot load it to R with `read.table()`.
Using `sed` to edit a tex file is, obviously, an overkill and done here only for demonstration purposes.

The following command demonstrates how to add a line to a text file using `sed`: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
linenum=10
sed -i "$linenum i This is the first sentence." foo.tex
```

Check the change via `git diff`. After doing so, go ahead and add this change to the repo:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add -u
git commit -m "Add first sentence to TeX file"
```

Now write a bash script which repeats the following cycle of steps for 9 times: adds a new sentence to `foo.tex` with `sed`, compile it, and commit *both* the TeX source file and its PDF output. 
I've provided starter code `edit_and_commit.sh` for this exercise. 
Once you have the bash script, execute it to make the 9 additional commits.
To sanity check that your script ran as expected, check the commit history via `git log` and check the changes made in the last commit via `git diff HEAD~1..`.
Then check the disk space usage of the `git_experiment_copy` folder. 
You can do this via `du -h -s git_experiment_copy` (`-h` for "human-readable" and `-s` for "summarize") or `du -h -s .` from inside the folder.

Next, make a fresh clone of the repo; you can remove the old one via `rm -rf stats-comp-algo-software-2024`.
And repeat the above process from the beginning, but without ever adding the PDF output to the repo.

**Tips:**
You can edit the bash script locally and transfer to JHPCE via `rsync -P git_experiment/edit_and_commit.sh your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/`.

**Question:** 
Does the size of the folder look reasonable relative to the sizes of the individual files inside it? 
(Use `ls -l -h` to list the files with the size info; `-l` is for "long.") 
If not, why would that be? 
Also, how do you explain the difference in the disk space usages under the two cases above?

**Your answer:** 

1. Does the size of the folder look reasonable relative to the sizes of the individual files inside it?  (Use `ls -l -h` to list the files with the size info; `-l` is for "long.") If not, why would that be? 

No it doesn't. The size of the folder (shown by using `du -h -s`) is much larger than the sum of the sizes of the individual files (shown by using `ls -l -h`). This is because:

- Block Allocation: The `du` command reports the actual disk space used by files under the directory, taking into account the block size (The total size of the blocks allocated to a file is usually larger than the size of the file). The `ls -l -h` command, on the other hand, reports the apparent size of the file, which is the actual size of the file, without taking into account the block size.

- Hidden files: The `du` command includes all files in the directory, including hidden ones. However `ls -l -h` does not show the hidden files like .git, so we are not actually summing the sizes of all the files in the directory.

- Cumulative size: The `du` command reports the cumulative size of the directory, including the sizes of all the files and subdirectories in the directory. The `ls -l -h` command, on the other hand, reports the size of the directory itself, which is usually much smaller than the cumulative size of the directory. i.e, `ls -l -h` command does not recursively sum the sizes of files in subdirectories.

2. Also, how do you explain the difference in the disk space usages under the two cases above?

In the first case, we track both the TeX source file and its PDF output. In the second case, we only track the TeX source file. Git does not work the best with the generated non-text files like PDFs. It is designed to track changes in text files, and it does not handle binary files as well as it does text files. When we track the PDF output, Git has to store the entire file for each commit, which can lead to a large repository size. When we only track the TeX source file, the repository size is much smaller because the TeX source file is a text file and Git can track changes in text files more efficiently. That's why the disk space usage is much larger when we also track the PDF output.

## Part B

You will now run the same experiment but on steroids, making a total of _10,000_ commits (plus the initial commit).
Start again with a fresh copy of the `git_experiment` folder and follow the same procedure as before.
This time, however, modify the bash script to make 9,999 additional commits and record the size of the `git_experiment_copy` folder after each commit.
You can use `du -s -k . >> git_repo_size_history.txt` for the latter purpose;
you may want to combine the `du` command with `awk '{print $1}'` to only record the size without extraneous information.
Since this is a long job that will take a non-trivial amount of JHPCE resource, just run this experiment once without committing the PDF output.
Also make sure to use `sbatch`, and _not_ `srun`, for such a long job.

**Tips:**
You can transfer the disk usage result from JHPCE to your local computer via 
`rsync -P "your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/stats-comp-algo-software-2024/homework/git_experiment_copy/git_repo_size_history.txt" git_experiment` (assuming that you are running the command from the `homework` folder).

**Question:** 
Plot the disk usage of the git repo with the number of commits on the $x$-axis.
Explain what you observe --- you may consult with resources on the web, including ChatGPT.
Based on this result and those from Part A, explain why [Github discourages you from commiting (large) binary files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)?

**Your answer:**

Each commit in Git creates a set of objects that represent the state of the files at the moment of the commit. Each object is stored as a separate file in the .git/objects directory. These are called "loose objects," and they can consume more disk space than necessary because they are not yet compressed. After a certain number of loose objects are created, or when the .git/objects directory becomes too large, Git will run its automatic garbage collection, packing those objects into pack files, which can drastically reduce disk usage. That explains why there is a periodic fluctuation in the disk usage of the git repo with the number of commits.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(file.path("..", "R", "colors.R"))

repo_size <- scan("git_experiment/git_repo_size_history.txt")
plot(
  # To be filled
  x = 1:length(repo_size),
  y = repo_size/1024,
  frame = FALSE, # Remove the ugly box
  col = jhu_color$heritageBlue,
  xlab = "Commit counts",
  ylab = "Repo size (MB)"
)
```

## Things to commit and submit

1. Completed `edit_and_commit.sh`
2. Answer to the question above, along with the plot


# Exercise 2: Setting up an R package skeleton

Set up your own version of the `hiperglm` package as we discussed in the class and put it up on your Github. The package set-up should have/include

* Proper R package structure; i.e. you can install it via `R CMD build/install`.
* MIT licence.
* Exported function `hiper_glm(design, outcome)` for model fitting.
* Exported S3 methods `coef`, `vcov`, and `print`.
* Clean and modular git history.

## Things to commit and submit

- Hyperlink to the `hiperglm` repository on your Github account
- Screenshot of the package's Git history visualized through a Git GUI of your choice

<img src="figure/git_history_screenshot.png" alt="Place the screenshot here"/>

**Note:** 
In case you decided to go with GitKraken via GitHub Student Developer Pack, the student status verification process could take a few days.
In the meantime, however, you should be able to start using the free version without any problem and to later enter your Pro account credential after the verification is complete.
