# Exercise 0: Setting up Git and Github

## Part 1: Command line interface 

Set up your Git and Github. 
You can find many resources regarding this online, including [a guide from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
Another nice one is Karl Broman's [minimal git/github tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/).
Make sure you at least set your Git username and commit email.

In this course, you will be mainly interacting with Git through its command-line interface. 
(In particular, I am not going to help you if you get yourself into trouble by using a Git GUI, like the RStudio one.)
If you are on Windows, you can use [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash). 
If you are on Mac, I recommend you use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), instead of the built-in Terminal, along with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and its [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. 
If you are on Linux, most likely you don't need my suggestions :-)

Besides the bare minimum Git set-up, you should also set up the default editor and visual diff tool. 
I personally use Sublime Text as the Git editor on macOS and, for those on Windows, Notepad++ is one popular option. 
As for visual diff, I like [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) but it is currently unavailable for latest macOS versions, unfortunately;
so I have been using [KDiff3](https://apps.kde.org/kdiff3/) instead.
The following commands tell Git to use Sublime and KDiff3:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git config --global core.editor subl --wait
git config --global diff.tool kdiff3
git config --global --add difftool.prompt false
```

All the above commands do is to simply modify the "global" `.gitconfig` file, typically located in your home directory. You can find the exact location of this file is via the command `git config --list --show-origin`. 

## Part 2: Graphical user interface

While I've just told you to use the command-line to interact with Git, a Git GUI can be a valuable tool for visually examining the current and past states of a repo.
So, my recommended workflow is to interact with Git via command-line (b/c it gives you more precise controls) but to use a GUI for visualizing the repo. 
I personally have been a happy user of a cross-platform [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), which is freely available via [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/). 
But other freeware like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) should work fine for the intended use of simply visualizing the repo. 

This part of the exercise used to be optional because it seems silly to micromanage peoples' workflows, but I have had many students not take my recommendation only to later tell me they wish they started using a Git GUI earlier.
So I am going to ask you to give it a try at least and to submit a screenshot of a package's Git history in Exercise 2.

## Things to commit and submit

The content of `.gitconfig` showing a proper Git set-up (though you would normally access this information via `git config` commands).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Paste the output of `cat .gitconfig` here
[user]
        email = wenxuanlu@hotmail.com
        name = Wenxuan Lu
[credential "helperselector"]
        selected = manager-core
[http]
        sslVerify = false
[https]
        sslVerify = false
[init]
        defaultBranch = main
[core]
        editor = 'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin
[diff]
        tool = kdiff3
[difftool]
        prompt = false
```



# Exercise 1: Playing around with command-line and Git

## Part A

Log in to JHPCE and `srun --pty bash` to be assigned a compute node. 
For this exercise, we use the `homework/git_experiment` folder from the course repository, so clone the repo to your JHPCE home directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/aki-nishimura/stats-comp-algo-software-2024
```

Next, copy the `git_experiment` folder via a command `cp -r git_experiment git_experiment_copy` (`-r` for "recursive" copy that includes the folder's contents and sub-directories).
Go into the copied folder, initialize it as a git repo (yes, you can have a git repo within another git repo), and commit `foo.tex`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git init
git add foo.tex
git commit -m "TeX file for experiment" 
```

Then try compiling the tex file via command-line, which can be done via:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
module load tex
pdflatex foo.tex
``` 

You can suppress the compilation messages by redirecting the `stdout` to `/dev/null`:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pdflatex foo.tex > /dev/null
```

For the rest of this exercise, you use a "stream" editor _sed_. 
A stream editor processes a text file line-by-line, without ever loading the entire file into memory. 
This is useful when, for example, you are processing a massive text file containing data and you cannot load it to R with `read.table()`.
Using `sed` to edit a tex file is, obviously, an overkill and done here only for demonstration purposes.

The following command demonstrates how to add a line to a text file using `sed`: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
linenum=10
sed -i "$linenum i This is the first sentence." foo.tex
```

Check the change via `git diff`. After doing so, go ahead and add this change to the repo:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add -u
git commit -m "Add first sentence to TeX file"
```

Now write a bash script which repeats the following cycle of steps for 9 times: adds a new sentence to `foo.tex` with `sed`, compile it, and commit *both* the TeX source file and its PDF output. 
I've provided starter code `edit_and_commit.sh` for this exercise. 
Once you have the bash script, execute it to make the 9 additional commits.
To sanity check that your script ran as expected, check the commit history via `git log` and check the changes made in the last commit via `git diff HEAD~1..`.
Then check the disk space usage of the `git_experiment_copy` folder. 
You can do this via `du -h -s git_experiment_copy` (`-h` for "human-readable" and `-s` for "summarize") or `du -h -s .` from inside the folder.

Next, make a fresh clone of the repo; you can remove the old one via `rm -rf stats-comp-algo-software-2024`.
And repeat the above process from the beginning, but without ever adding the PDF output to the repo.

**Tips:**
You can edit the bash script locally and transfer to JHPCE via `rsync -P git_experiment/edit_and_commit.sh your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/`.

**Question:** 
Does the size of the folder look reasonable relative to the sizes of the individual files inside it? 
(Use `ls -l -h` to list the files with the size info; `-l` is for "long.") 
If not, why would that be? 
Also, how do you explain the difference in the disk space usages under the two cases above?

**Your answer:**

**No.** The size of the folder returned from `du -h -s .` is much larger than the sum of file sizes returned from `ls -l -h`. The reasons are as follows:

  1. `du` detects the actual amount of disk space used, which is the sum of sizes of blocks that are allocated to the folder. As long as the block is allocated to the folder, the whole block size will be counted even if only a portion of it is filled. On the other hand, `ls` reports the actual file size and does not count the unfilled parts of the blocks.
  2. `du` includes all the files when calculating the disk space usage. On the other hand, `ls -l -h` does not include the hidden files. `ls -la -h` will show that there is an additional hidden folder `.git`. Moreover, `ls` does not recursively calculate the folder or subfolder size. Using `du -h -s .git` shows that the `.git` folder takes the majority of space. It is because Git stores folder history and commits information, which takes a lot of space.
  3. `du` includes the overhead, such as metadata and structures, of the folder, whereas `ls` only consider the file sizes.


**Now compare the two cases.** After 10 commits, the sizes of individual (non-hidden) files are almost the same. However, the `.git` hidden folder is much larger in the first case when `foo.pdf` is committed. This is because:

  1. In the first case, Git needs to keep track of more files, and tracking the additional file `foo.pdf` takes additional space.
  
  2. Git is not space-efficient for tracking binary files. Git uses zlib to do compression when saving loose objects. This is efficient for text files, such as `foo.tex`, but is not efficient for binary files. This is because many binary files, such as complied PDFs and images, have been compressed. Moreover, the delta compression used for garbage collection is not efficient for binary files. Delta compression stored a compressed version of the incremental changes for tracked files. This works well for `foo.tex` where we were adding one sentence at a time. On the other hand, small changes in `foo.tex` file may result in large changes in the compiled PDF `foo.pdf`. Moreover, Git usually treats binary files as a whole even if only a small portion is changed. Thus, delta compression does not work well for `foo.pdf`, which leads to decreased efficiency in garbage collection and a much larger `.git` folder.


## Part B

You will now run the same experiment but on steroids, making a total of _10,000_ commits (plus the initial commit).
Start again with a fresh copy of the `git_experiment` folder and follow the same procedure as before.
This time, however, modify the bash script to make 9,999 additional commits and record the size of the `git_experiment_copy` folder after each commit.
You can use `du -s -k . >> git_repo_size_history.txt` for the latter purpose;
you may want to combine the `du` command with `awk '{print $1}'` to only record the size without extraneous information.
Since this is a long job that will take a non-trivial amount of JHPCE resource, just run this experiment once without committing the PDF output.
Also make sure to use `sbatch`, and _not_ `srun`, for such a long job.

**Tips:**
You can transfer the disk usage result from JHPCE to your local computer via 
`rsync -P "your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/stats-comp-algo-software-2024/homework/git_experiment_copy/git_repo_size_history.txt" git_experiment` (assuming that you are running the command from the `homework` folder).

**Question:** 
Plot the disk usage of the git repo with the number of commits on the $x$-axis.
Explain what you observe --- you may consult with resources on the web, including ChatGPT.
Based on this result and those from Part A, explain why [Github discourages you from commiting (large) binary files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)?

**Your answer:** 

**Observation:** 

As the commit number increases, the folder size increases linearly. After thousands of commits, there are drops in the folder size in a few consecutive commits. For the following commits, the folder size increases linearly again. This trend repeats as more commits are made, and the folder size is within a reasonable range at all time. 

**Reasoning:**

Linear increase: Each time when I commit, Git stores the current version of the file `foo.tex` and information about the commit as a loose object within `.git/objects`. Moreover, `zlib` compression is applied to these loose objects. Since the tex file is small and the changes are minimal, each commit results in a separate object of similar sizes. This causes the linear increase in the folder size.

Size drop: When the folder size hits some threshold, Git will automatically perform garbage collection to optimize the disk space usage. In our case, it is primarily done by using the delta compression to store only the differences between commits. Moreover, multiple small objects are packed into a single packfile which further reduces space usage. Since we only made small changes to `foo.tex`, the garbage collection is particularly efficient, and the drop in folder size is dramatic. Note that this optimization is gradual over several commits in order to spread the loads, achieve better compression rate, and decrease the risk of data loss or corruption.

Trend repetition: After the garbage collection, the following commits result in new loose objects. This causes a linear increase in disk size, and the trend repeats itself.

**Explain why Github discourages you from commiting (large) binary files**

The answer for Part A explains the low efficiency of Git in compressing binary files both for the loose objects and during the garbage collection. This causes the `.git` folder to be large when binary files are changed and committed frequently. Large repositories can be slow in operation and can cause burden on either local or remote hosts. 

Some other reasons not to commit large binary files include hard to use diff tools to compare binary files and hard to merge when conflict occurs.


```{r, eval=TRUE}
source(file.path("..", "R", "colors.R"))

repo_size <- scan("git_experiment/git_repo_size_history.txt") # repo size in KB
repo_size_MB = repo_size / 1000
plot(
  x = 1:length(repo_size_MB),
  y = repo_size_MB,
  type = "l",
  frame = FALSE, # Remove the ugly box
  col = jhu_color$heritageBlue,
  xlab = "Commit counts",
  ylab = "Repo size (MB)"
)
```

# Exercise 2: Setting up an R package skeleton

Set up your own version of the `hiperglm` package as we discussed in the class and put it up on your Github. The package set-up should have/include

* Proper R package structure; i.e. you can install it via `R CMD build/install`.
* MIT licence.
* Exported function `hiper_glm(design, outcome)` for model fitting.
* Exported S3 methods `coef`, `vcov`, and `print`.
* Clean and modular git history.

## Things to commit and submit
