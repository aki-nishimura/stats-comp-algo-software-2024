# Instruction on how to complete and submit homework

In this course, you will complete and submit assignments using Git and Github.

To start, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this class repo into your Github account.
Then complete and submit the first assignment as follows: 
1) make a `hw1` branch from the `main` branch,
2) commit a completed assignment in the `hw1` branch, and
3) create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

We will grade the HTML rendered version of your homework submission, so make sure all your work is shown there.

For a subsequent assignment, [sync up your forked copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) before you start the assignment. 
Name the new branch to match the assignment number (e.g. `hw2` for the 2nd assignment).
Otherwise follow the same procedures as above.


## Grading of the R package development

As a part of the homework assignments, you will be progressively developing a high-performance R package for generalized linear models. 
For this part, you will be graded not only on functionality but also **quality** of your code.

We (the instructor and TA's) will use Githubâ€™s [code review feature](https://github.com/features/code-review) to provide feedback on how to improve your code.
We will leave a comment on each of the identified issues ans attach negative points (e.g. `-10`) based its severity.
You have the opportunity to get part of the points back by addressing these issues in the subsequent assignment submission.

We will start grading on code quality at the second assignment, when you start implementing actual functionalities.
Since there is a learning curve to writing good code, at this first grading on code quality for the second assignment, you can get 100% of the points back if you fully address the comment. 
You can only get up to 50% back in subsequent assignments.
When the issue is a recurring one, we might only point it out once but you will still have to address every instance of it in your code to get the maximum points back.
