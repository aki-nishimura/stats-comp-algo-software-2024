# Exercise 0:

Watch the following videos from Part "The Central Processing Unit (CPU): Crash Course Computer Science" from PBS to better understand how CPU works and what affects its computational performance:

-   [The Central Processing Unit (CPU)](https://youtu.be/FZGugFqdr60?si=Cth8Sw_Z_p7Jwqvg)
-   [Instructions & Programs](https://youtu.be/zltgXvg6r3k?si=1jRqi8x6rfiQ4Gri)
-   [Advanced CPU Designs](https://youtu.be/rtAlC5J1U40?si=VCicsBN-GGMVX4ty)

**Question:** In class, we have observed that execution speed of the `sign_via_if()` Rcpp function can depend on the value of an input vector.
What feature(s) of a modern CPU is (are) responsible for this?
-   Speculative execution is responsible for this. sign_via_if relies on a conditional statement (which becomes a Conditional Jump Instruction). Older CPU would stop their pipeline at conditional jumps and wait for the value return, resulting in longer execution time in all cases. Nowadayas, instead, they guess which value will be return by conditional statement and proceed with pipeline in a speculative way. If they were right, then time is saved by doing this. Otherwise, if CPU guessed wrong all commands after the conditional jump have to be executed again.  Becase of this, we observe different execution speed based on input (becuase whether the guess is right depends on input values).

And where in the above videos is this explained?

# Exercise 1: Coding on the edge --- being responsible for your own safety in the C++ world

## Part A: Buggy inner product

Below is a (buggy) Rcpp implementation of an inner product calculation.

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Ignoring the bug for the moment, run the code below and see what you get.

```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp"))

vec_size <- 1023L
v <- rep(1, vec_size)
w <- rep(1, vec_size)
inner_prod(v, w)
```

Still ignoring the bug, run the code below that calculates the same inner product many times and checks whether the output remains the same.
I mean, whether there is a bug or not, an output of a deterministic calculation should surely be the same each time?
Try running the code chunk multiple times.

```{r, error=TRUE}
first_val <- inner_prod(v, w)

for (i in 1:10^6) {
  v <- rep(1, vec_size)
  w <- rep(1, vec_size)
  subseq_val <- inner_prod(v, w)
  if (!identical(first_val, subseq_val, num.eq = TRUE)) {
    print(subseq_val)
    stop("The last inner prod result disagrees with the previous ones.")
  }
}
```

**Questions:** What behavior do you observe above?
How do you explain it?
**Answers:**

-   The calculation returns different results each time I run it.
    I have found multiple different results, all around 1022.

-   The issue has to due with zero-indexing and accessing memory not allocated for the vectors v and w.

    -   C++ uses zero-indexing so the correct implementation would loop from i=0 to v.size() - 1.
    
    -   Due to the above, the product of the first entry of v and w is not added to the inner product, hence why we often get results around 1022 (instead of 1023)
    
    -   Also due to point 1, we try to add $v_{1023}w_{1024}$ to the inner product. Because these vectors are dedfined as having size 1023, they do not have a 1024th entry. Vectors are stored as consecutive "numbers" (I think in the background a C/C++ vector is a pointer to the memory location of the start of the vector and then indexing tells the computer how many steps to move from the beginning). What ends up happening is that the computer accesses the memory spot just after vector v and that just after vector w and adds their product to the dot product. These two values are not necessarily initialized to zero, and the location of vector v and w is different whenever the vectors are created so different blocks of memories (that may both contain nonzero values) are accessed with every iterations, hence we obtain different results. 

## Part B: Sloppy matrix-matrix multiplication

You have been told by the instructor that error-checking is particularly important in C++ and, in particular, that you should probably check for the dimension compatibility before you multiply two matrices in Rcpp(Eigen).
But it would be fair enough to wonder: is that dude really worth listening to?
I'll leave that for you to judge, but for this part of exercise let's consider what might happen if we remove such a safeguard from an Rcpp matrix-matrix multiplication.
Below is an implementation without the dimension check:

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Run the code below using the above "unprotected" matrix-matrix multiplication.

```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp"))

A <- matrix(1, nrow = 4, ncol = 1024)
B <- matrix(1, nrow = 512, ncol = 2)

dgemm_eigen(A, B)
```

**Questions:** What do you get as an output?
What if you re-run the code chunk?
Explain the observed behavior.

**Answers:**

-   The first column is always 1024, the second column varies with re-runs and contains numbers of difficult interpretation

-   Again, matrices are stored contiguously in memory. When doing $A*B$, what happens is that:

  -   For the first column of the result, each row in matrix A needs to be multiplied by a "column" of B. Because row of A contains 1024 entries, column of B must also contain 1024 entries. Hence, we happens is that both columns of B are treated as B's first column. Then, each entry of the first column of the results is 1024 times the product of 1 by 1, so we get 1024
  
  -   When, it comes to the second column of the result, each row in A must be multiplied by the 1024 "cells" contiguous to where matrix B is stored (because the values actually in B have already been considered as column 1). Again, what is adjacent to B in memory is different every time we create B, so results vary (of course, all rows in the same run have the same values because the identical rows of A are all multiplied by the same "unknown" 1024 values) 

## Part C: Consequence of "tresspassing"

The code below uses the `axpy_c()` function as seen in lecture.
Run it and see what happens.
(I am not sure if the behavior is reproducible 100% of time; if you don't observe anything striking, restart the R session and run the code chunk in a fresh state.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "axpy_c.cpp"), rebuild = TRUE)

a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e7L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e3L)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

Now try running the code below; it should execute just fine unlike the above one.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e3L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e7)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

**Questions/To-do's:**

-   What happens when you run the first code chunk above and why? Running the same piece of code from an R console (instead of an RStudio session) should give you more information on what actually happens.
-   Why does the second code chunk run fine?
-   Modify `axpy_c.cpp` to make the function safer to use.

**Answers:**

-   The first chunk of code causes the R session to crash. That is because we pass to axpy_c a vector y with of length $10^3$, when x is of length $10^7$. Therefore, in the function, we try to access element $1001$ (and so on) of vector y, which don't exist. Sometimes, the computer is smart enough to prevent us from accessing memory not allocated for y, which causes the session to crash.

-   The second code chunk runs fine because the vector sizes are reversed. We only access the $10^3$ of a $10^7$ vector. Of course, mathematically, the function doesn't perhaps do what the user intended: the first $10^3$ entries of y become 3.14159 in this case, while the remaining once are unchanged.

-   The axpy_c.cpp is separately pushed to github. Basically, I simply added a check that x and y have the same size because only in that case $ax+y$ makes mathematical sense. However, to just make the function safer I could have created another vector from the result doing   NumericVector result(n);  and then setting result[i] = a*x[i] + y[i] in the loop

# Exercise 2: Multiplying two matrices ain't quite what you learned in your linear algebra class

## Part A: Paying homage to your linear algebra teacher

As we all learned in our linear algebra class, the matrix product $\boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B}$ of $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and $\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times p}$ has its elements defined as $$C_{ij} = \sum_{\ell = 1}^k A_{i\ell} B_{\ell j}.$$ So a conceptually natural way to implement a matrix multiplication is looping through each row of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and column of $\boldsymbol{B}$, taking inner products of the pairs of vectors:

![](figure/matrix_multi_via_row_col_dot.gif){width="30%"}

Implement a matrix-matrix multiplication based on this approach as `row_col_dot_matmat` using the starter code provided in the `matmat.cpp` file.
Then check that its output agrees with the base R matrix multiplication.

```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "matmat.cpp"))
```

```{r}
set.seed(111)
n_row_out <- 1024L
n_inner <- 2048L
n_col_out <- 512L
A <- matrix(rnorm(n_row_out * n_inner), nrow = n_row_out, ncol = n_inner)
B <- matrix(rnorm(n_inner * n_col_out), nrow = n_inner, ncol = n_col_out)
```

```{r}
# Check the output of `row_col_dot_matmat`
base_R = A%*%B
lin_alg_teacher = row_col_dot_matmat(A,B)
all.equal(base_R, lin_alg_teacher)
```

## Part B: Going one step beyond your linear algebra class

We now consider an alternative approach to matrix-matrix multiplications, noting that we can think of a matrix product $\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B}$ as each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ multiplied by $\boldsymbol{A}$: $$\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} = \big[ \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_1 \, | \, \ldots \, | \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_p \, \big].$$ Recalling from lecture that "column-oriented" matrix-vector multiplication is more efficient than "row-oriented" one for R matrices, implement `col_oriented_matmat` (in `matmat.cpp`) that loops through each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ applying the column-oriented matrix-vector multiplication.
Then compare performances of `row_col_dot_matmat` and `col_oriented_matmat` (but only after you test your column-oriented implementation).
Which one is faster and why?
```{r}
lin_alg_advanced = col_oriented_matmat(A,B)
all.equal(lin_alg_teacher, lin_alg_advanced)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# benchmark
bench::mark(
  row_col_dot_matmat(A,B)
)
```

```{r}
# benchmark
bench::mark(
  col_oriented_matmat(A,B)
)
```
Also compare with performance of the matrix-matrix multiplication via `%*%` in R, which uses whatever the BLAS library your R was configured with.
(You can find out which BLAS library R is using via `sessionInfo()` or `extSoftVersion()`.)

```{r}
# Fill in
bench::mark(
  A%*%B
)
```
**Answers:**
-   col_oriented_matmat much more efficient (17x fold with the given A and B sizes) than row_col_dot_matmat. I believe this ahs to do with vectorization and the ability using col_oriented_matmat to calculate results one column at the time, instead of cell by cell.

-   Base R is comparable to col_oriented_matmat. Which algorithm is faster varies based on A and B, but both take around 900ms.


When benchmarking alternative implementations (or alternative algorithms, more generally), keep in mind that the relative performance depends significantly on the size of a test problem.
It is important, therefore, to benchmark your implementation/algorithm on problems of realistic size.
See the benchmark results of linear algebra libraries from [the Eigen development team](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark) and the results under "Gcbd benchmark" in [this github repository](https://github.com/andre-wojtowicz/blas-benchmarks), for example.

## Part C: Doing it the right way

Part A & B are meant to get you some practice writing Rcpp code and to illustrate how much an algorithm's performance depends on whether or not it respects an underlying representation of data.
Neither of the approaches we've discussed, however, is the most effective way to multiply two matrices on modern hardware.

Dedicated linear algebra libraries typically deploy *blocking*, dividing the matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ into sub-matrices of appropriate size and carrying out multiplications block-wise.
This approach is designed to minimize the data motion between CPU and RAM by re-using the same pieces of data as much as possible once they travel all the way from RAM to L1 cache.
In practice, we of course shouldn't try to implement, let alone optimize, an operation ourselves when there already are efficient software libraries available.
(But, if you are interested in learning more about how the optimized matrix multiplication works, Sec 1.5.4. of Golub and Van Loan (2013) is a good place to start.
Also, I found nice lecture slides on this topic [here](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/lecture/18cacheX.pdf).)

### Rcpp, Eigen, and compiler options

With the interface provided by RcppEigen, the C++ linear algebra library [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) is one obvious choice for dealing with computationally intensive numerical linear algebra tasks in R.
But the optimized C++ code provided by Eigen is *only one part of the equation*: in order to achieve the best performance, we have to provide appropriate instructions to the compilers on how to translate the C++ code into machine code specific to each hardware and operating system.
These instructions are given in terms of *compiler flags*.
I am far from an expert on compiler flags, so the rest of discussion is accurate only to the best of my knowledge --- let me know if you find out any part of it to be inaccurate.

Rcpp by default applies the level 2 optimization via flag `-O2` when compiling your Rcpp code.
This flag is a shorthand for turning on a collection of more specific flags and generally leads to efficient machine code without any major drawbacks.
I've been told that the more aggressive level 3 optimization via `-O3` can sometimes hurt performance or even break things.
Which specific flags `-O2` activates to some extent depends on which (version of) compiler you are using.
Generally speaking, however, the level 2 optimization misses some of the important optimization opportunities for scientific computation, such as fused multiply-add (FMA) and AVX's 256-bit vectorized operation discussed in class.
SSE's 128-bit vectorization seems to be activated by `-O2` with Clang (the default compiler for macOS) as of version 12.0.0, but I am not sure how to confirm it and [their documentation is not particularly helpful](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/clang.html#cmdoption-o0).
If you are on Linux and using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), then you can run `gcc -O2 -Q --help=target` to find out which exact options are enabled by the `-O2` option.

In compiling Rcpp code, you can turn on and off these additional options by modifying the R version of a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefiles) called `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` for Unix and Windows respectively.
To specify the compiler options for a specific R package, you can place such an Makevars file under the `src/` directory.
To specify the global options that affect all Rcpp code compilations on your computer, you can edit the Makevars file at the location given by `tools::makevars_user()`, which is typically `~/.R/Makevars` in Unix.
For example, to turn on AVX(2) and FMA, you would add a line `CXXFLAGS += -mavx2 -mfma` in the Makevars file; to turn off SSE, you woud add `CXXFLAGS += -mno-sse`.
You can read more about the role of Makevars files [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43597632/understanding-the-contents-of-the-makevars-file-in-r-macros-variables-r-ma).

**To-do's:** Using the `dgemm_eigen()` function from lecture, compare the performances of Eigen's and your custom matrix-matrix multiplication compiled under different optimization options.
Selectively turn on and off SSE, AVX2, and FMA to see how each option affects the performances.
(SSE should be turned on by `-O2` unless explicitly turned off, but if `-mno-sse` makes no performance difference, then try `-msse` or `-msse4`.) Finally, turn on both AVX2 and FMA and check the resulting performances.
Report what you find.

Next, implement an RcppEigen function `dgemv_eigen()` that computes the matrix-vector product $A v$ given the input matrix $A$ and vector $v$ of compatible sizes.
Then, using the same matrix $A$ as an input to `dgemv_eigen()`, repeat the above experiment of turning on and off the optimization flags.
Contrast the results on the matrix-vector operation with those on the matrix-matrix operation using RcppEigen.
Explain why these hardware optimization options may have the different degrees of impacts on performance.

Run the above experiment both on your own computer and on a JHPCE node.
In case you have a Mac computer with Apple silicon, then the experiment won't work on your computer, so just use JHPCE.
In addition to the results, report the CPU model on the JHPCE node you ran the experiment on; you can check this via the `lscpu` command.
The few really old nodes on JHPCE do not support AVX and FMA, so switch to another node in case you get assigned to those nodes.
You can check supports for AVX and FMA from the output of `lscpu`; try `lscpu | grep avx` and `lscpu | grep fma`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Import `dgemm_eigen()` from lecture
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("..", "lecture", "src", "gemm_eigen.cpp"))
```

```{r}
# Benchmark
bench::mark(
  dgemm_eigen(A, B)
)
```
This is about a 6-fold improvement when compared to col_oriented_matmat(A,B). 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Import `dgemv_eigen()` 
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("..", "homework","src", "gemv_eigen.cpp"))
```

```{r}
set.seed(111)
v = rnorm(2048)
```

```{r}
# Benchmark
bench::mark(
  dgemv_eigen(A, v)  
)
```

```{r}
bench::mark(
  A%*%v
)
```
dgemv_eigen(A, v) is about 5 times quick than base R A%*%v.

Unfortunately, the line below return character(0) on my laptop, so I didn't knwo how to go about changing compiler settings
```{r}
tools::makevars_user()
```
**JHPCE**
Model name:            Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650L v3 @ 1.80GHz

I obtain results:

-   dgemm_eigen(A,B):

  -   -02: median of 328ms

  
  
-   dgemv_eigen(A,v):

  -   -02: median of 1.08ms


-   A%*B: median of 1.04s

-   A%*%v: median of 6.78ms

In general, things ran quicker on my computer.
  
I unfortunately run into the same issues on the cluster. I cannot change Makevars globally becuase I don't know where the Makevars file is. When I create a Makevars file inside a project in the src directory, updating the Makvars file and the  re-running the Rcpp::sourceCpp() function does not seem to make a different. The benchmark results are (up to minor fluctuations) always the same. 



# Exercise 3: Continuing development of `hiperglm` --- optimizing its performance via RcppEigen

In the previous assignment, you improved the numerical stability of the `hiperglm` package by replacing the pseudo-inverse within Newton's method with the QR-based weighted least-square solver.
In this assignment, you will improve the computational speed by interfacing the package with RcppEigen.

Before you start this assignment, remember to first address all the feedback from the previous assignment and merge your previous work to the main branch.
Then create a new `rcpp-eigen` branch from there, check it out, and commit all your work for this assignment there.
Finally, open a pull request into your main branch after completing the assignment and request a review from the TA.

1.  Use `usethis::use_rcpp_eigen()` to set up the use of Rcpp(Eigen) within the package.<br> *Remark:* Within an R package, Rcpp code needs to be placed in `.cpp` files under the `src/` directory. After you've written Rcpp functions, you need run `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` to make those functions available to the rest of the package. See the ["Using Rcpp in a package"](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html#rcpp-package) section in *Advanced R* and references therein if you want to learn more.
2.  Replace base R's QR functions with RcppEigen's and test that their outputs agree. Don't forget to run `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` after writing Rcpp functions. Below you find tips on how to use Rcpp(Eigen) which, combined with the lecture materials, should be sufficient for completing this step:
    -   Calling the constructor function `Eigen::HouseholderQR<Eigen::MatrixXd> qr(A);` computes the QR decomposition of a given `A` of type `Eigen::MatrixXd` and assigns it to the variable `qr`. In other words, this is a shorthand for initializing the variable `qr` by first calling `Eigen::HouseholderQR<Eigen::MatrixXd> qr(A.rows(), A.cols());` and then actually computing and assigning to `qr` the output of QR decomposition by calling `qr.compute(A);`. You can then call `qr.solve(y);` to compute the least squares solution $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \boldsymbol{R}^{-1} \boldsymbol{Q}^\intercal \boldsymbol{y}$.
    -   If you want to use `using ...;` within a package, you have to place these statements within a header file called `pkgname_types.h` under `src/` and include it in the `.cpp` files via `#include "pkgname_types.h"`. For example, the name of the header file should be `hiperglm_types.h` in our case.
    -   *Remark:* You can find more about Eigen's HouseholderQR class [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1HouseholderQR.html). Note that, as typical of many cutting-edge open-source technologies, their documentations are generally adequate but not particularly user-friendly. Some of the details might just require educated guesses and trial-and-errors. You can find useful examples in Dirk Eddelbuettel's [page on RcppEigen](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.eigen.html). But then RcppEigen is just an Rcpp wrapper of Eigen, so you might just have to refer to Eigen's documentation for further details.
3.  Incorporate the least squares solver via Eigen's QR into the IWLS algorithm for finding MLE. Make it the default option and check that all the tests still pass when using the QR-based solver.
