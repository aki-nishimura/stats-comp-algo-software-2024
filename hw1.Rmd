# Exercise 0: Setting up Git and Github

## Part 1: Command line interface

Set up your Git and Github.
You can find many resources regarding this online, including [a guide from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
Another nice one is Karl Broman's [minimal git/github tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/).
Make sure you at least set your Git username and commit email.

In this course, you will be mainly interacting with Git through its command-line interface.
(In particular, I am not going to help you if you get yourself into trouble by using a Git GUI, like the RStudio one.) If you are on Windows, you can use [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash).
If you are on Mac, I recommend you use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), instead of the built-in Terminal, along with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and its [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.
If you are on Linux, most likely you don't need my suggestions :-)

Besides the bare minimum Git set-up, you should also set up the default editor and visual diff tool.
I personally use Sublime Text as the Git editor on macOS and, for those on Windows, Notepad++ is one popular option.
As for visual diff, I like [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) but it is currently unavailable for latest macOS versions, unfortunately; so I have been using [KDiff3](https://apps.kde.org/kdiff3/) instead.
The following commands tell Git to use Sublime and KDiff3:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git config --global core.editor subl --wait
git config --global diff.tool kdiff3
git config --global --add difftool.prompt false
```

All the above commands do is to simply modify the "global" `.gitconfig` file, typically located in your home directory.
You can find the exact location of this file is via the command `git config --list --show-origin`.

## Part 2: Graphical user interface

While I've just told you to use the command-line to interact with Git, a Git GUI can be a valuable tool for visually examining the current and past states of a repo.
So, my recommended workflow is to interact with Git via command-line (b/c it gives you more precise controls) but to use a GUI for visualizing the repo.
I personally have been a happy user of a cross-platform [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), which is freely available via [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/).
But other freeware like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) should work fine for the intended use of simply visualizing the repo.

This part of the exercise used to be optional because it seems silly to micromanage peoples' workflows, but I have had many students not take my recommendation only to later tell me they wish they started using a Git GUI earlier.
So I am going to ask you to give it a try at least and to submit a screenshot of a package's Git history in Exercise 2.

## Things to commit and submit

The content of `.gitconfig` showing a proper Git set-up (though you would normally access this information via `git config` commands).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Paste the output of `cat .gitconfig` here
[user]
	email = apignatelli@college.harvard.edu
	name = alepigna12
[core]
	editor = C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop\\Notepad++.lnk
[diff]
	tool = C:\\Program Files\\KDiff3\\kdiff3.exe
[difftool]
	prompt = false
```

# Exercise 1: Playing around with command-line and Git

## Part A

Log in to JHPCE and `srun --pty bash` to be assigned a compute node.
For this exercise, we use the `homework/git_experiment` folder from the course repository, so clone the repo to your JHPCE home directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/aki-nishimura/stats-comp-algo-software-2024
```

Next, copy the `git_experiment` folder via a command `cp -r git_experiment git_experiment_copy` (`-r` for "recursive" copy that includes the folder's contents and sub-directories).
Go into the copied folder, initialize it as a git repo (yes, you can have a git repo within another git repo), and commit `foo.tex`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git init
git add foo.tex
git commit -m "TeX file for experiment" 
```

Then try compiling the tex file via command-line, which can be done via:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
module load tex
pdflatex foo.tex
```

You can suppress the compilation messages by redirecting the `stdout` to `/dev/null`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pdflatex foo.tex > /dev/null
```

For the rest of this exercise, you use a "stream" editor *sed*.
A stream editor processes a text file line-by-line, without ever loading the entire file into memory.
This is useful when, for example, you are processing a massive text file containing data and you cannot load it to R with `read.table()`.
Using `sed` to edit a tex file is, obviously, an overkill and done here only for demonstration purposes.

The following command demonstrates how to add a line to a text file using `sed`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
linenum=10
sed -i "$linenum i This is the first sentence." foo.tex
```

Check the change via `git diff`.
After doing so, go ahead and add this change to the repo:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add -u
git commit -m "Add first sentence to TeX file"
```

Now write a bash script which repeats the following cycle of steps for 9 times: adds a new sentence to `foo.tex` with `sed`, compile it, and commit *both* the TeX source file and its PDF output.
I've provided starter code `edit_and_commit.sh` for this exercise.
Once you have the bash script, execute it to make the 9 additional commits.
To sanity check that your script ran as expected, check the commit history via `git log` and check the changes made in the last commit via `git diff HEAD~1..`.
Then check the disk space usage of the `git_experiment_copy` folder.
You can do this via `du -h -s git_experiment_copy` (`-h` for "human-readable" and `-s` for "summarize") or `du -h -s .` from inside the folder.

Next, make a fresh clone of the repo; you can remove the old one via `rm -rf stats-comp-algo-software-2024`.
And repeat the above process from the beginning, but without ever adding the PDF output to the repo.

**Tips:** You can edit the bash script locally and transfer to JHPCE via `rsync -P get git_experiment/edit_and_commit.sh your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/`.

**Question:** Does the size of the folder look reasonable relative to the sizes of the individual files inside it?
(Use `ls -l -h` to list the files with the size info; `-l` is for "long.") If not, why would that be?
Also, how do you explain the difference in the disk space usages under the two cases above?

**Your answer:** (To be filled.)

It does not look reasonable.
It seems that with every commit that whole file is stored "from scratch", which leads to larger repository size.
In other words, all versions are stored, rather being overwritten.

The second way uses less space because we do not have the PDF file, which is way larger than TeX.
However, the size of the folder is still unreasonable due to multiple commits.

## Part B

You will now run the same experiment but on steroids, making a total of *10,000* commits (plus the initial commit).
Start again with a fresh copy of the `git_experiment` folder and follow the same procedure as before.
This time, however, modify the bash script to make 9,999 additional commits and record the size of the `git_experiment_copy` folder after each commit.
You can use `du -s -k . >> git_repo_size_history.txt` for the latter purpose; you may want to combine the `du` command with `awk '{print $1}'` to only record the size without extraneous information.
Since this is a long job that will take a non-trivial amount of JHPCE resource, just run this experiment once without committing the PDF output.
Also make sure to use `sbatch`, and *not* `srun`, for such a long job.

**Tips:** You can transfer the disk usage result from JHPCE to your local computer via `rsync -P "your_username@jhpce03.jhsph.edu:/users/your_username/stats-comp-algo-software-2024/homework/git_experiment_copy/git_repo_size_history.txt" git_experiment` (assuming that you are running the command from the `homework` folder).

**Question:** Plot the disk usage of the git repo with the number of commits on the $x$-axis.
Explain what you observe --- you may consult with resources on the web, including ChatGPT.
Based on this result and those from Part A, explain why [Github discourages you from commiting (large) binary files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)?

**Your answer:** (To be filled.)

In the plot, we initially see the repository size increase considerably with each commmit because Git stores full copies of those binary files.
However, at a certain point size suddenly decreases because Git performs garbage collection: unreferenced objects are removed.
Then, the cycle repeats.

Git discourages commiting large binary files because the process takes up a lot of memory and hinders performance.

```{r}
repo_size <- scan("C://Users//alepi//git_repo_size_history.txt")
plot(
  # To be filled
  x = seq_along(repo_size),  
  y = repo_size,
  frame = FALSE, # Remove the ugly box
  col = "blue",
  xlab = "Commit counts",
  ylab = "Repo size (MB)"
)
```

## Things to commit and submit

1.  Completed `edit_and_commit.sh`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cd "${HOME}/stats-comp-algo-software-2024/homework/git_experiment_copy"

for commit_count in {2..10}
do
  let linenum="10+$commit_count"
  sentence_to_add="This is Sentence $commit_count."
  # Fill in
  sed -i "$linenum i $sentence_to_add" foo.tex
  git add -u
  git commit -m "Add sentence $commit_count to TeX file"
done
```
