# Setting up a Git repo and GitHub remote for an R package

**Note**: In class, we started with a package name `hiperLogit` and variable names `*logit*`; this was mainly to demonstrate the tools like `grep` and `find` you can use to refactor code later. 
In setting up the package for your assignment, you can start directly with a package `hiperglm` and variable names `*glm*`.

- Initialize `hiperLogit` package skeleton
  * `usethis::create_package("~/hiperLogit")`
  * Create a Github repo `hiper-logit-demo` and set it as a remote
  * `usethis::use_mit_license()`
    - Open the repo on GitKraken for visual diff
    - Permissive vs. copyleft
    - Personal view: Use MIT license as as a default, Apache if your employer asks for it, and GPL if you have to
  * Edit DESCRIPTION
    - "Title: High-performance logistic regression for large data sets"
    - Set author and creator (more details on these roles [here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012/RJ-2012-009/RJ-2012-009.pdf))
    - "Description: TBA"
- Top-down programming: start with a high-level overview of what the program does and then recursively break it down into sub-routines
- Outline function signatures:
  * `R/hiper_logit.R`
  * `hiper_logit <- function() {...}`
    - What input args should the function take?
    - Input `design` and `outcome`
    - Check for supported models
    - Warn that the function is yet to be implemented
    - Make a todo note to implement model fitting
    - Return an empty list: `hlogit_out <- list()`
  * `model_output.R`
    - No need to write a feature-rich package right from the beginning, but what are the min required outputs for this package to be a valuable resource for statistical analysis?
    - `coef`, `vcov`, (and `print` since that's kinda obligatory)
- Now install the package via `R CMD build/install` and try calling `hiper_logit()`
- Oops, I forgot to export functions...
  * `#' @export`
  * Roxygenize
- Oops, I overwrote `base::print()`...
  * Turn the output into an S3 object: `class(hlogit_out) <- "hlogit"`
  * Add `.hlogit` to the model output functions
  * (After forgetting to do so,) Roxygenize again
- Decide, out of whim, to change the package name from `hiperLogit` to `hiperglm`
  * Gotta replace all the "logit" word from the repo: `git grep --ignore-case logit`
  * Rename variables with `find R -type f -name "*.R" -exec gsed -i 's/glm/logit/g' {} \;` (since RStudio currently doesn't support refactoring)
  * Also need to change all the file names: `find * -iname "*logit*"`
  * Rename git repo
  * Change remote url `git remote set-url origin ...`
- Clean up the git history via `git rebase -i` before pushing
  * Is the record of this change of some value to others and my future self?
